Installation
------------

Installing libHaru on Linux/Unix is as easy as this:
./configure && make && make install

If you're using a Git checkout or a Github tarball, 
don't forget to run ./buildconf.sh in order to create 
./configure script.

See more detailed instructions here:
https://github.com/libharu/libharu/wiki/Installation

Alternatively, you can build and install libHaru using [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager:

    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
    cd vcpkg
    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
    ./vcpkg integrate install
    ./vcpkg install libharu

The libHaru port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.
