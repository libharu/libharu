2008.01.19 first release
version '2.0.8'
1. All of the C API is usable

2. known problems
1) demo\text_demo.py, there are 2 bugs
one, Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "H:\libharu-2.0.8\pyharu\demo\text_demo.py", line 357, in <module>
    main()
  File "H:\libharu-2.0.8\pyharu\demo\text_demo.py", line 208, in main
    "RenderingMode=PDF_FILL")
  File "H:\libharu-2.0.8\pyharu\demo\text_demo.py", line 62, in show_description
    c = HPDF_Page_GetRGBFill (page)
ValueError: Procedure called with not enough arguments (4 bytes missing) or wrong calling convention

Often, that msg happends when we load a Cdll with Windll method, vice versa. But why here?

two, if I comment out "c = HPDF_Page_GetRGBFill (page)", the yieled pdf has a unexpected layout

2) ttfont_demo.C and ttfont_demo.py, in other words, that is the problem with haru
ttfont_demo.exe  .\ttfont\PenguinAttack.ttf -E
ttfont_demo.exe  .\ttfont\PenguinAttack.ttf
no characters appear

ttfont_demo.exe  c:\winnt\fonts\arial.ttf -E
many rectangles appear

ttfont_demo.exe  c:\winnt\fonts\arial.ttf -E
no characters appear

3) try to make_rawimage.exe, fails. So that maybe the problem in haru too.
make_rawimage.py fails too
python H:\libharu-2.0.8\pyharu\demo\make_rawimage.py png_demo.pdf 11.pdf
ERROR: Invalid PNG image format., detail_no=0          <==crazy haru
