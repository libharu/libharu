To use this interface, you need to build Haru as a static library (.a) or use 
the binary package for win32.

There is an example program in this directory. 
The steps to run the demonstration program are as follows:

1. Build libHaru as a static library and copy libhpdf.a to your source 
   directory.
   If you want to build libhpdf on win32 platforms you need either
   MinGW/MSYS or Cygwin.
 
2. Put the include (.bi) files in your source directory.

3. Compile and run the demo program.

   a) compile with: fbc hpdftest.bas
   b) run with:     hpdftest.exe (on win32) or ./hpdftest (on linux)

NOTE:
libhpdf.a is required to run the program which uses the FreeBasic interface for
libHaru.
