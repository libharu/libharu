To use this interface, build Haru as a shared-library (DLL) or use binary 
package for win32(libharu_x_x_x_dll_win32.zip).

There are some example programs in demo directory. The steps to run the 
demonstration programs is as follows. 

1. Build libharu as a shared library and copy libhpdf.dll to "if\c#\demo"
   directory. (Or expand binary package for win32(libharu_x_x_x_dll_win32.zip) 
   and copy libhpdf.dll to "if\c#\demo" directory.)

2. Compile and run demo programs. (Don't forget to compile hpdf.cs together.)

   csc /out:FontDemo.exe FontDemo.cs ..\hpdf.cs 
   FontDemo.exe

   csc /out:ImageDemo.exe ImageDemo.cs ..\hpdf.cs 
   ImageDemo.exe

   csc /out:JPFontDemo.exe JPFontDemo.cs ..\hpdf.cs
   JPFontDemo.exe

   csc /out:LineDemo.exe LineDemo.cs ..\hpdf.cs
   LineDemo.exe

   csc /out:OutlineDemo.exe OutlineDemo.cs ..\hpdf.cs
   OutlineDemo.exe

   csc /out:Encryption.exe Encryption.cs ..\hpdf.cs
   Encryption.exe

   csc /out:Permission.exe Permission.cs ..\hpdf.cs
   Permission.exe

   csc /out:RawImageDemo.exe RawImageDemo.cs ..\hpdf.cs
   RawImageDemo.exe

   csc /out:TextDemo.exe TextDemo.cs ..\hpdf.cs
   TextDemo.exe

Because I do not know the Visual studio well, I do not explain usage on Visual 
Studio here.  


NOTE:
libhpdf.dll is required to run the program which uses C# interface for libharu.
I tested this interface only in Microsoft .NET Framework SDK 1.1.
